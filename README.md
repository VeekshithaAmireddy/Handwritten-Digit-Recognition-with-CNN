"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Handwritten Digit Recognition using TensorFlow and Keras. This code loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses the images, builds a CNN model, and evaluates its performance. It also includes an example of making predictions on a custom test image."

# Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

This repository contains Python code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to recognize handwritten digits. It uses the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.

## Contents

- `digit_recognition_cnn.py`: Python script containing the code.
- `test_image.png`: Example custom test image for prediction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `digit_recognition_cnn.py` to train the model and make predictions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- PIL

Install the necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

- Run `digit_recognition_cnn.py` to see the CNN in action.
- To make predictions on your own images, replace `test_image.png` with your custom image.

## Results

- The model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set.

## Acknowledgments

- The code in this repository is based on a tutorial by [Link to Tutorial].
